NOTICE
=================


Since IFC adn the MVDs are now maintained in the new UML + MD based system, IfcDoc is not used anymore. The ownership of the IfcDoc code is unclear, and there is no clear insight and control over the license under which it is published, we cannot keep it under the buildingSMART organization any longer.
This repository will be relocated and archived this Friday February 18, 2022 CET.
 
We are aware there are community members that might want to retain access to the code. Please do so before the deadline.
If anyone of you wants to claim ownership, please email technical@buildingsmart.org before February 18 2022 so we can facilitate the transfer.
